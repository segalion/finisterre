Finisterre (The Board Game)

This is a project of a free “Print and Play” board game called “Finisterre (The Board Game)”.

Although the initial idea was a simple family game and relatively easy to play and bring to the table, I think it has turned out to be something that would be categorized as a simple-rules but medium-hard “pure moving-cubes” eurogame.

I consider the game to be quite original, combining several fairly common mechanics such as tile placement and resource management.

It has a lot of interaction, and I have tried to scale it well from 2 to 5 players, with games between 40 and 120 minutes.

It is currently in the final phase of development, before testing and debugging begins (currently it is not fully balanced). 

Although it is quite independent of the language, it is only available in Spanish.

I have made a great effort in the graphic part to make it attractive to many people and that it can be tested as much as possible, so I will appreciate any suggestion or contribution in this regard.

The thematic aspect of the game has been quite careful:
Create villages and forts in each region and roads that connect them. Carts and boats to transport resources such as wood, iron, gold, and food to feed the population: hunting, fishing, agriculture, and livestock. It will be necessary to trade, minting coins and buying and selling. Deal with all kinds of events: the passage of time, weather conditions, fires, plagues and diseases, floods, robberies and attacks, alliances and confrontations, new objectives (sometimes secret, sometimes global). Spirituality (druids, bards, offerings, etc.) is very important, as the proper use of your specialists (fishermen or farmers, carpenters and blacksmiths, lumberjacks and fighters, spies and merchants, ...)

Minimum material requirements:
•	A color printer, paper, and scissors.
•	Many 3-color cubes (which can be substituted for coffee, chickpeas, silver foil) and many 4-color dice.
•	Coins of two types.

Introduction:
We are located on the Galician coast in the middle of the Iron Age (several centuries before the arrival of the Romans). Specifically in the territories of what we know today as Finisterre, recreating the arrival of the first Celtic populations in the Iberian Peninsula.
 "Your family clan will create new settlements in the territories that you discover, making use of the resources that you find or generate!"

Thank you.
